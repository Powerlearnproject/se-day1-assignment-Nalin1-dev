Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing, testing and maintaining software to ensure high quality software.
it is important as it ensures that the software build is maintenable and of high quality.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1structured engineering- emphasised on modularity and code organization
2. object oriented programming- focuses on concept of objects which contain data and behaviour
3.agile software development- collaborative approach which focuses on flexibility.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirement gathering- collecting and documenting system requirements
2. design- converting requirements into models that represent hardware and software
3. implementation-  coverting requirents into  actual coding.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. waterfall follows a pretedermined procedure of doing things ie it folows one step after the  other while iterative is an iteractive and relies on the feedback of one step to move to the nest development step.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1.designing and developing the code- desing the code as per user requirements
2 team collaboration. team up with other members to ensure that they develop solutions
3.testing the code for functionality and checking of errors
4. documentation ofcode and procedures
5. communication to stakeholders on the progress of the work

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. ides provide set of tools  for developer towrote develop and, compile and debug code while vcs manage different types ofsource code and manage developers


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. degugging - this can take alot of time and be overcome by using system provide ides to check for errors early can solve the problem.
2. code quality is difficult to maintain. follow the quality asurance standards to ensure proper coding
3. 3.collarobation is difficult when a bifg team is involved in code design. ensure that is a centralized point for code sharing.
4. testing. modules have to be tested to ensure that they meet the functionality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing ensure testing individual components of code
2. integration testing involve testing how different components of code work together
3. system testing involves testing the entire software to ensure that it eets systm requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
1. it is the process of defining clear instructions to interact  with the ai tools
2. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt can be tell me about the road
the more improve can be tell me about the distance of the road from nairobi to kisumu.
the mproved prompt tells the ai to provide the concent about the topic that have enough clear information.
