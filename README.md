# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing, testing and maintaining software to ensure high quality software.
it is important as it ensures that the software build is maintenable and of high quality.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1structured engineering- emphasised on modularity and code organization
2. object oriented programming- focuses on concept of objects which contain data and behaviour
3.agile software development- collaborative approach which focuses on flexibility.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirement gathering- collecting and documenting system requirements
2. design- converting requirements into models that represent hardware and software
3. implementation-  coverting requirents into  actual coding.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. waterfall follows a pretedermined procedure of doing things ie it folows one step after the  other while iterative is an iteractive and relies on the feedback of one step to move to the nest development step.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1.designing and developing the code- desing the code as per user requirements
2 team collaboration. team up with other members to ensure that they develop solutions
3.testing the code for functionality and checking of errors
4. documentation ofcode and procedures
5. communication to stakeholders on the progress of the work

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
